Over 12 months ago, I switched to the [Halmak keyboard layout](https://github.com/MadRabbit/halmak).

I blogged about it at the end of 2019. Since then, I periodically get emails and DMs on Twitter asking me if I kept going with it.

The answer is "Yes".

I use Halmak every day on my [Koolertron AE-SMKD62](https://www.amazon.com/Koolertron-Programmable-Mechanical-Keyboard-Ergonomic/dp/B076FTNXDX), and when I need to type silently at night on my [Anne Pro 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnePro/comments/li4mqv/dsa_hana_keys_with_halmak_layout/).

## Some observations 

It turns out that a texting (thumb) keyboard and touch-typing are stored in different parts of the brain. I touch-type with Halmak, but that is not transferrable to texting on my phone. Nor does using a Halmak layout on my phone transfer to touch-typing.

So, I use the standard QWERTY layout on my phone, and Halmak on my computer. 

I posted my [Anne Pro layout on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnePro/comments/li4mqv/dsa_hana_keys_with_halmak_layout/), and a Reddit user shared that staggered and [ortholinear](https://thenewzly.com/2021/02/25/what-is-an-ortholinear-keyboard-and-should-really-you-use-1/) keyboard layouts seem to be stored in different parts of the brain, [saying](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnePro/comments/li4mqv/dsa_hana_keys_with_halmak_layout/gnlb5xr?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):

>  I'm on an ortholinear keyboard so it's slightly different from the original. I started learning it last year. I'm not as fast as I would like. I can still type ok on qwerty, but only on a normal keyboard, not on my ortho which is strange. Guess I've kept those two separate in my brain

Learning to touch-type with Dvorak got rid of my QWERTY touch-typing, and Halmak got rid of my Dvorak ability. If you want to keep two touch-typing layouts, then I'd recommend doing one on a staggered keyboard and the other on an ortholinear.

Some people ask "_What do you do if you need to type on someone else's computer?_".

The simple answer is: "_I don't._"

In the sense that I don't need to type on someone else's computer.

I loaded Halmak as the native layout on both my keyboards, so if I ever needed to do that, I can just connect my Anne Pro over bluetooth (or plug it in). But I haven't had to do that. 

A couple of times in the last year, I've typed something on my son's computer, and hunt and peck on his QWERTY keyboard - but it's been literally twice.

## Summary

So, I'm still on Halmak after one year, and loving it.
