A lot has happened since my last update on this website. I won the 2021 ICN Classic Physique championship Open Division in April 2021 at 48 years of age; my wife of 24 years passed away from cancer in November 2021; I participated in the 2022 NZ Parliament Occupation from day 1 till Freedom Village burned down, singing the Hare Krishna maha-mantra every day for three weeks with other Hare Krishna devotees (you can see us in the documentary movie [River of Freedom](https://riveroffreedom.nz)); I married again, with someone I met at the occupation; and we moved to the countryside, where we are growing food and protecting cows.

And through all of that, I continue to use the [Halmak keyboard layout](https://github.com/kaievns/halmak). It seems to have moved to a new owner since I last checked, and it has been receiving updates.

I'm still using my daily driver keyboards: a [Koolertron AE-SMKD62](https://www.amazon.com/Koolertron-Programmable-Mechanical-Keyboard-Ergonomic/dp/B076FTNXDX), and [Anne Pro 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnePro/comments/li4mqv/dsa_hana_keys_with_halmak_layout/).

These keyboards are configured with Halmak layouts in firmware, meaning no setup required on the computer. I was using the MacOS Halmak layout via the bundle, but had problems with it randomly not being selectable as an input. Using a hardware layout removes computer configuration.

On the internal keyboard of my laptop - which I'm using to type this now while at a conference in NYC - I use [the Karabiner layout from the README in the repo](https://github.com/kaievns/halmak#karabiner-elements). This is a new addition since I last checked the repo, and it works more reliably than the MacOS keyboard layout bundle. I set this up last week, before leaving home, and it is working really well. 

## Some observations 

I have a custom mapping where I can press the Capslock key and use effectively "WASD" to move the cursor, and I use this a lot. 

Halmak is an alternating layout, similar to Dvorak. By placing all the vowels under the right hand, you typically end up alternating between left and right fingers, as English words contain a lot of vowel-consonant-vowel combinations.

My son - who uses QWERTY - complained that Halmak is evil because it reverses C and V, the shortcuts for copy and paste. I do find myself accidentally copying an empty line instead of pasting the buffer, frequently enough to notice it. 

## Summary

After three years of using Halmak, I'm still on it, and I don't see myself changing away from it.
