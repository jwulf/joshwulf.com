I've been using the Halmak keyboard layout for six years now. 

My typing speed is still not back to what it was on QWERTY. I used that one for over 20 years. I like to joke that "_my typing speed is 60% what it used to be, but I feel 40% more elite_".

## Observations

Halmak is similar to Dvorak — it has the vowels on one side (the right hand). This means that a lot of typing is alternating hands, since alternating vowels and consonants is a common pattern in English. 

This actually loses a lot of "combo rolls" that you get on QWERTY. 

C and V are reversed compared to QWERTY, which is still sometimes confusing for my muscle memory. 

C, V, and X (copy, paste, and cut) are all next to each other on a QWERTY keyboard. As well as reversing C and V, the Halmak layout places X on the other hand, which ruins single hand cut and paste.

Yeah, I'm not going back.
