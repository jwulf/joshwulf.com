# Meaningless, Repetitive Work 

## Hilariously Honest IT Job Ads from the Legendary Recruiter

![alt](/img/main/cnet.png)

This is a selected twenty-five of the ads that I wrote while working as a Technical Recruiter, each accompanied by a brief backstory of the ad.

Here is some of the press that my ads got at the time:

* <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/the-worlds-worst-it-job-ad/">c|net: Repetitive, meaningless work: The world's most honest IT job ad</a>
* <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/04/17/job_ad_promises_meaningless_repetitive_work_on_the_net_stack/">The Register: Job ad promises 'Meaningless Repetitive Work on the .NET Stack'</a>
* <a href="https://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/is-this-the-funniest-job-ad-of-all-time/3062631/">Sunshine Coast Daily: Is this the funniest job ad of all time?</a>
* <a href="https://www.digi.no/artikler/lokker-med-meningslost-repetitivt-arbeid-pa-net-stakken/348075">digi.no: Lokker med meningsløst, repetitivt arbeid på .NET-stakken</a>

If you are a digital recruiter, you might treat this like those design books that contain pages and pages of postcard designs - drawing inspiration for your own job ads. You might even read the backstory and get some inspiration on the role that you play in the digital ecosystem where you live.

If you work as a developer, you might get a laugh of recognition from some of the stories told in the ads - like reading a Dilbert comic.

If you live in Brisbane, you may well recognise some of the people that I mention by name in the ads or the back stories. You should have seen the parts of this book that the lawyers made me take out!
